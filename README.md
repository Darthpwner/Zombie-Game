Drop brains and try to kill all the zombies

Move your character (represented as "@") around the board using the following directionals: "n" (Up), "e" (Right), "s" (Down), and "w" (Left). Pressing "X" will drop a brain in your spot and/or cause your character to stay in the same spot. Pressing "Enter" will cause the computer to choose the "best move" for you based on the danger presented by the zombies around you. If a zombie eats a brain, it will do one of two things. 1) After the first brain, it will move every other turn. 2) After the second brain, it will die. The goal is to try to kill all the zombies on the board. Good luck!
